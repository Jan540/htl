# SQL-Injection Lab 🕵️‍♂️💻

In this hands-on lab, you're diving into the world of a Student Grades Platform – a web app that stores and displays student grades. It is possible to exploit so called SQL-Injection. To learn what SQL-Injection is and how to exploit it you will have a couple of objectives.

## Lab Objectives 🎯

1. **Login without authorization:**: Log in as a user without knowing the password.
2. **Steal user data:**: Steal the data of a specific user you want to hack.
3. **Give a master hacker access to an account:** Give a hacker access to an account of your choice.

## Instructions 📝

# The Exciting Login Page Adventure 🚀

Greetings, tech adventurers at HTL Wien West! Get ready for an exhilarating mission: unraveling the mysteries of the Homework Management System (HMS) through the magical world of its guardian, the login page.

## Chapter 1: Logging In

Your mission's first phase is all about understanding the login page. Imagine it as the protector of a digital party, where the username and password fields are its loyal companions. Your golden ticket to the exclusive HMS club is the correct username-password duo.

How do you think such a login is implemented on the server? What happens when you enter your username and password? Have a look at the code:

```python
result = fetch_data_from_db('SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = "' + username + '" AND password = "' + hashed_password + '" ;')
```

Do you notice anything vulnurable?

### What can be exploited?

Do you know how Comments are written in SQL? They start with `--` and everything after that is ignored. Could you use this to your advantage?

What does this SQL Command do?

```sql
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username = "user@account.com" --" AND password = "xxx" ;
```

<Question questionNr={1} />

Nice work! It seems you understand the basics of how this works.

### Time for your ninja hacker move 🥷

In our current scenario we know that our current teacher is `leo.borek@htlwildwest.at`. What would you need to write into the username field to log in as him?

<Question questionNr={2} />

Now execute your ninja move 🥷 on the right side of your screen and... voilà! You've successfully logged in as `leo.borek@htlwildwest.at`. Picture your victory dance 💃 as you transform into the mighty leo.borek👨‍🏫!

## Chapter 2: Stealing the User Data

You can see that on this page there is a search bar. This search bar is used to search for homework. The search term is used to search for the subject of the homework.

The output of the search is displayed in a table.

Can we use this search bar to output the data of the users table instead of the homework table?

This is how the server handles the code underneath:

```python
result = fetch_data_from_db('SELECT subject, description,due_date FROM homework WHERE subject LIKE "%' + search_term + '%"')
```

Do you remember the mighty gruber's class on sql unions?

We could try to use a union on the users table. Lest try to get the role, username and password of the users table. The Server should use this query:

```
SELECT subject, description,due_date FROM homework WHERE subject LIKE "%math" UNION SELECT role,username,password FROM users --%"
```

What do you need to enter to get the server to use this query?

<Question questionNr={3} />

### Time for your ninja hacker move 🥷 _Part 2_ 🎬

Enter the search term into the search bar and execute your ninja move 🥷 on the right side of your screen. You will see the data of the users table displayed in the table below.

## Get beo.lorek hacked

The next steps should be taken over by the premium pentester Rashia Eisi.

To hack the system, he needs the password hash of the user `leo.borek`. Can you help him out?

## Let's fix it!

Now your expertise 🧠 is needed to fix the vulnerability. How can you prevent the user from injecting SQL commands? 🤔

Think of some ideas and submit the Document to google classroom. Also add screenshots with the correctly awnsered questions and your google username visible to get your points.

Happy hacking, stay safe! 🔒🛡️
